# Contoso-Sales-Dashboard
This dashboard was created from the famous "Contoso" Database, which I extracted, treated and Loaded through SQL.  It contains sales information regarding this fictional company called Contoso.

My main focus with this dashboard was to give an overview of the company throughout a three year period, comparing income, profits and gross margin through these years; then focus on the products sold by the company, as well as information regarding brand, product category and sub-category so I could search for patterns and tendencies; and for the third page, focus on the stores and regions covered by Contoso. The stores and regions page includes a Pareto Chart, where it is possible to observe how few stores are responsible for a big volume of income.
